## Plans

The ultimate goal of this repository is to provide a digital dataset of Assyrian words in a programmatically consumable format, such as JSON/CSV. The first step is to collect dictionaries (in digital format) that are available for free. 

## Standards

This repository should not include dictionaries that are not free. No harm should be caused to any author and/or publisher, not just to respect copyrights and avoid affecting their financial outcome, but to also prevent discouraging authors from producing dictionaries.
