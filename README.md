## Plans

The ultimate goal of this repository is to provide a digital dataset of Assyrian words/definitions in a programmatically consumable format, such as JSON/CSV. 

All the fields that one would expect from the common dictionary should be included, along with some additional data when available.

- Syriac spelling (Eastern and Western)
- Pronunciation in translated language
- Type of word
- Definition in translated language
- Definition in Assyrian, itself (both Eastern and Western)
- Example usage (multiple sentences)
- Verb tenses
- Source (the dictionary from which the data has been adapted)
- Possible place of origin
- Possible language of origin (Akkadian, Aramaic, borrowed from a known language, etc.)

The first step is to collect dictionaries (in digital format) that are available for free. 

## Outcome

Once the datasets are available, mobile and web developers will be able to develop Assyrian dictionary, thesaurus, and language-based apps. It's evident that there are many who have interest in developing an Assyrian dictionary app, but - apparently - the datasets haven't been available in a programmatically consumable way.

At the time of writing this, there are a couple of mobile app developers who are trying to produce Assyrian dictionary apps; however, the apps depend on an internet connection. This is due to the fact that they have to use the available web service APIs (most of which depend on the same web service).

## Standards

This repository should not include dictionaries that are not free. No potential harm should be caused to any author and/or publisher, not just to respect copyrights and avoid affecting their financial outcome, but to also prevent discouraging authors from producing dictionaries. 

Available dictionary web services should not be scraped to collect data. This would not only be harmful to the authors/publishers of the web-based dictionary, it would also be harmful to the language, as it could discourage further development of the dictionary. 

## Notes

The most well-developed web-based Assyrian dictionary has been under continuous development for over a decade with almost 40,000 words. With that having been stated, this dataset is not going to be developed overnight.
