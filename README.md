## Plans

The ultimate goal of this repository is to provide a digital dataset of Assyrian words/definitions in a programmatically consumable format, such as JSON/CSV. 

All the fields that one would expect from the common dictionary should be included, along with some additional data when available.

- Syriac spelling (Eastern and Western)
- Pronunciation in translated language
- Type of word
- Definition in translated language
- Definition in Assyrian, itself (both Eastern and Western)
- Example usage (multiple sentences)
- Verb tenses
- Source (the dictionary from which the data has been adapted)
- Possible place of origin
- Possible language of origin (Akkadian, Aramaic, borrowed from a known language, etc.)

The first step is to collect dictionaries (in digital format) that are available for free. 

## Standards

This repository should not include dictionaries that are not free. No harm should be caused to any author and/or publisher, not just to respect copyrights and avoid affecting their financial outcome, but to also prevent discouraging authors from producing dictionaries.
